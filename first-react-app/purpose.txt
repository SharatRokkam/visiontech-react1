When we create react project we get lot of files and folders lets see the purpose of each file and folder

// Purpose : Contains all the dependencies(external libraries) your project needs, which are installed via npm or yarn
// Do not touch this folder......anyday

// This folder contains all the static files like audio, video, images, favicon...

3. SRC 
//this is place where 99% of the time we spend time while development, this folder will have components, Css files, JS logic, pages

4. .gitignore - related git and github..
// This files tell which files and folders need to ignore when committing code.
